# Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts salaries based on user input features like education level, years of experience, major, programming languages used, and more. Built using Python and scikit-learn, it demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and deployment with Streamlit.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for front-end)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🗃️ Dataset

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training using Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Evaluation using RMSE and R² Score
- Visual comparison of predicted vs actual salaries
- Saved model pipeline using `joblib`
- Simple UI built with Streamlit
